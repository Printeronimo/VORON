# This is a Voron specific cfg file  with pressure advance modified on 180517 by Michael Lanfranconi
# This file serves as documentation for config parameters of corexy
# style printers. One may copy and edit this file to configure a new
# corexy printer. Only parameters unique to corexy printers are
# described here - see the "example.cfg" file for description of
# common config parameters.

# DO NOT COPY THIS FILE WITHOUT CAREFULLY READING AND UPDATING IT
# FIRST. Incorrectly configured parameters may cause damage.

# The stepper_x section is used to describe the X axis as well as the
# stepper controlling the X+Y movement.
